# WalNet 

In today's fast-changing tech world, more and more people need powerful computers. Walnet is a new solution to this problem. It combines cloud computing with the Sui blockchain to create a strong and safe system for users.

Walnet  let users access powerful computer resources for many different tasks. This combination makes Walnet a useful tool for various computing needs.

Walnet's first version (MVP) is already working well. It has some great features:

- Users can easily upload files to their own space in the cloud, making it safe and easy to access their work
- People can play games directly on the Sui blockchain, showing how decentralized gaming could work in the future

Our team want to make Walnet a central place for projects that connect blockchain technology with real-world infrastructure. People can share their computer resources to support Walnet and help it become a central hub in Depin.

As Walnet grows, it will play a big role in changing how we use cloud gaming on blockchain.
